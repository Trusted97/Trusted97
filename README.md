👋 Hello, fellow developers and technology enthusiasts, 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile. 🌟 I would like to take a moment to introduce myself and share an overview of my professional background and interests in the field of technology.

💼 I currently serve as a Backend Developer on the DX team at Immobiliare.it. With a strong passion for development, I focus on designing and implementing reliable, scalable, and efficient backend solutions that enhance both user experience and overall system performance.

⚙️ My technical expertise includes PHP (using the Symfony and CodeIgniter frameworks), Python, and Rust. I also have extensive experience with database technologies such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, as well as Elasticsearch, which I utilize to deliver advanced and responsive search functionalities.

🥋 Outside of my professional work, I am deeply committed to martial arts, actively practicing Ju-Jitsu and Judo. These disciplines have taught me discipline, perseverance, and mental focus, qualities that I apply consistently in my professional and personal pursuits.

📸 In my free time, I enjoy photography as a creative outlet. Capturing unique moments and exploring new perspectives through my lens allows me to relax while continuing to cultivate creativity and attention to detail.

I am also passionate about tabletop gaming, particularly role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. I enjoy storytelling, world-building, and collaborative problem-solving—activities that strengthen my creativity, adaptability, and teamwork, all of which are invaluable in software development.

🃏 Another interest of mine is Magic: The Gathering. Whether I am building decks, analyzing strategies, or participating in friendly matches, the game continuously challenges my strategic thinking, patience, and foresight, skills that align closely with my approach to software design and development.

🚀 I am committed to continuous learning and staying informed about emerging technologies and industry trends. Personal growth and professional excellence are guiding principles in both my career and independent projects.

🤝 I firmly believe that collaboration is one of the most powerful aspects of software development. I thrive in team-oriented environments where knowledge is shared openly, and complex challenges are addressed through collective expertise.

🔒 Please note: I am not currently seeking new job opportunities. I am content in my current position and kindly request that recruiters respect this.
