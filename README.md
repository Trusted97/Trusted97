👋 Hello there, fellow developers and coding enthusiasts! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🌟 Let me give you a brief glimpse into my tech journey:

💼 I'm currently working as a backend developer for the DX team at Immobiliare.it. With a passion for web development, I specialize in creating robust and efficient solutions.

⚙️ My developer stack includes PHP (Symfony and CodeIgniter frameworks), Python, Rust, and expertise in database management (MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL). I'm also proficient in Elasticsearch for enhancing user experiences with powerful search capabilities.

🥋 In addition to my love for coding, I'm also passionate about martial arts! I practice Ju-Jitsu and Judo, which brings discipline, focus, and physical well-being to my life.

📸 When I'm not immersed in the world of coding or martial arts, you can find me behind the lens as an amateur photographer. Capturing moments and exploring the world through photography is a hobby that brings me joy and allows me to unleash my creative side.

🚀 I'm always eager to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies, constantly striving for continuous improvement.

🤝 Collaboration is key! I enjoy working with cross-functional teams, exchanging ideas, and brainstorming innovative solutions to complex problems.

🔒 Please note that I'm not currently open to recruitment opportunities. I'm content with my current position and not actively seeking any changes. So, dear recruiters, including yourself, kindly refrain from reaching out.

Thank you for visiting my profile! Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or want to discuss the exciting world of coding! 🤓✨
