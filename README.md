👋 Hello, fellow developers and tech enthusiasts! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🌟 Let me take a moment to introduce myself and share a bit about my journey in the world of technology.

💼 I’m currently working as a backend developer on the DX team at Immobiliare.it. With a strong passion for web development, I focus on building reliable, scalable, and efficient backend solutions that help improve user experience and system performance.

⚙️ My technical toolkit includes PHP (with Symfony and CodeIgniter frameworks), Python, and Rust. I have solid experience in database technologies such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, as well as in Elasticsearch, which I use to implement powerful and responsive search features.

🥋 Outside the tech sphere, I’m deeply committed to martial arts. I actively practice Ju-Jitsu and Judo, which have helped me develop discipline, perseverance, and mental focus — qualities I also apply in my professional life.

📸 When I’m not coding or training, I enjoy photography as a creative outlet. Capturing unique moments and exploring new perspectives through my lens is something I find both relaxing and rewarding.

🐉 I'm also a passionate tabletop gamer, especially when it comes to role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons. I love storytelling, building immersive worlds, and collaborating with friends to create epic adventures. It's a great way to sharpen my creativity, improvisation skills, and teamwork — all of which translate into my approach to problem-solving in tech.

🃏 Another hobby I’m truly enthusiastic about is Magic: The Gathering. Whether I'm deck-building, analyzing card synergies, or competing in friendly matches, the strategic depth of the game constantly challenges my thinking. It teaches me patience, foresight, and adaptability — traits I bring to software development as well.

🚀 I’m always eager to learn about new technologies and stay on top of industry trends. Personal growth and continuous improvement are core values that drive me forward in both my career and personal projects.

🤝 I believe collaboration is one of the most powerful tools in development. I thrive in team environments where ideas flow freely and complex problems are tackled through collective effort.

🔒 Please note that I'm not currently exploring new job opportunities. I’m happy in my current role, so I kindly ask recruiters to respect this and refrain from reaching out.
